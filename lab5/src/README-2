Q2.2
int[] Board = new int[45];
Q2.3
1.Board[0] = 20; Board[1] = 5; Board[2] = 1;Board[3] = 9; Board[4]
= 10; Board.len()=45;Board.size()=5
2.illegal: total number of cards beyond 46
3.Board.[0] = 45; capacity = 45; size = 1
4.illegal: total number of cards less than 45
5.Board[0-44] = 1; capacity:45; size:45
6.illegal: negative number
7.Board[0] = 1; Board[1] = 0; Board[2] = 44; capacity = 45;size:3

Exercise 3
all elements in array should be non-negative
all elements added equals to 45
0 <= Board <= 45
